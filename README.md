## Overview
This repository contains a self-contained R project for **statistical and multivariate analysis** of the COVID-19 pandemic using a public dataset derived from Worldometers.  
All code, methods and figures are embedded in the **PDF report**; the **CSV** dataset used in the analysis is included for transparency and reproducibility.

Main topics covered:
- Data cleaning and descriptive statistics
- Distribution fitting (Gamma, Exponential, Weibull, Log-Normal)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Cluster tendency and clustering
  - Hierarchical (Ward, single, complete, average linkage)
  - Partitioning (K-Means, K-Medoids)
- Cluster validation and distance metrics (Euclidean vs Manhattan)
